# HW-Code-Refactor
Week 1 Homework - Code Refactor

By Angel Alexander

Changes I made:

- Got rid of divs, added different attributes for accessibility
  - header, nav, main, section, aside, footer
- Combined some of the classes in CSS to make it less repetative
- Added comments to clearly see where elements are in the code
